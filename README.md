# Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository pertaining to our journal: _Imputation of missing values in well log data using k-nearest neighbor collaborative filtering_.

Our research utilizes the collaboritve filtering algorithm to make predictions of the missing well log data values. 

# Files
The repository contains the following files:
* Imputation_WellLog_CF.ipynb
* WellLog_Visualization.ipynb
* CF_Results.ipynb
* Various csv files used in our research

Note: CSV files are too large to be uploaded on GitHub. Files have been uploaded to our Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LF-T2Wq7Yzg5h_xImviSUwuH3P_2oOr_?usp=sharing

Our research utilized the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for easier analysis and visualzation. Please install Jupyter Notbook or use Google Colab, a free-online Jupyter Notebook, to open the ipynb files. 

If you want to use other coding environemnts, copy and paste the codes and files to your preferred coding environment (IDE etc.).

# Python Libraries
Our research utilizes various Python libraries that needs to be installed:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-Learn

If you use Google Colab, Google Colab already has built-in various Python modules, so no installation is necessary.
